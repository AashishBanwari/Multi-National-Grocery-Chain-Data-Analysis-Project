These dashboards will display key performance indicators (KPIs) related to Overall business performance, sales, product, customer insights and store performance. The aim is to empower stakeholders with real-time insights to track performance and identify areas for improvement.
C. Data Analysis and Reporting: Power BI's analytical capabilities will be leveraged to perform in-depth analysis of the organization's data. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in sales, customer behavior, and market dynamics. The project will also involve generating regular reports for different departments and stakeholders, ensuring timely access to relevant information.

Used  **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to manipulate, aggregate, and analyze data within the reports. With functions like SUM, AVERAGE, FILTER, and time intelligence functions, I was able to calculate values, apply filters, perform time-based analysis, and create custom expressions. It also helped to support relationships between tables and allowed to retrieve data from related tables. 
By leveraging DAX functions, the project enhances the analytical capabilities of Power BI, enabling the creation of insightful visualizations and accurate calculations to support data-driven decision-making.
